# React with @preact/signals-react as state management

Signals basically remove the need for using useState and useEffect to manage state. And with Signals, you don't even have to pass data through component props, similar to provide/inject from Vuejs.

The old way with useState and useEffect you can see on the [old-way](https://github.com/fanesz/react-signals/tree/old-way) branch.
